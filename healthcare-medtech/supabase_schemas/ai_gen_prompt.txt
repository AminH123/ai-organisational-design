I need you to make some sample dentistry patient record data using the following format:

Staff List:
- id (staff id, unique increment integer)
- first_name (random)
- last_name (random)
- cert_ids (AZaZ09-AZaZ09-AZaZ09)

Appointment History:
- record_id (links to the patient)
- attendant_1 (required, staff_id)
- attendant_2 (optional, staff_id)
- assistant_1 (optional, staff_id)
- assistant_2 (optional, staff_id)

Dentist Notes:
- record_id (links to the patient)
- title (the type of appointment; orthodontist, cleaning, etc)
- text (make some relevant notes about what was found, what changed from previous notes)

Patient Record Data:
- first name (random)
- last name (random)
- date of birth (random DD-MM-YYYY)
- identification_num (put as 0000-0000-0000-0000-0000)
- address  (put as PRIMARY_ADDRESS)
- address_secondary (put as SECOND_ADDRESS)
- phone (put as 00-000-000-000)

Expand this into multiple patients with linked appointment histories and notes and multiple staff members
